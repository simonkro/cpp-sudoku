# Sudoku

Toying around with the new C++11 standard, trying to go as much in
the functional direction as possible. The algorithm used is quite
similar to my haskell version - and its almost as short.

Nevertheless it wasn't easy to write - even with auto variables
and lambdas (both are incredible usefull) I still feel like
constantly (pun intended) fighting the compiler.

## Usage

    make
    ./sudoku < puzzle.txt
